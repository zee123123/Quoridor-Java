Minor Version 02
Author @ Bishal Biswas (With help of other member)

In this version in accordance with the previous one Menu window is created from where one can go to the main playing board after selecting New Gane button. In the menu image is added for the visualization. 

Some bugs are fixed in this version of previous code. A back button is implimented so that players can go back to the menu and start a new game or exit. 

A help option is created for the players who wants to know the game rules. 

A runnable jar file is uploaded for the marker. Now Mac does not show the background image. And I could not fix it.

N:B:     1. Load button is still not implimentd for this version.
         2. Four players and their selection is still not implimented.
         3. AI is still not implimented.
         4. Restricted number of walls are not implimented.
         5. Display setting is not implimented.

All these will be implimentd in the final version; agreed by all the group members. 


Professor told us to mention this to the marker for this iteration. Thank you.
