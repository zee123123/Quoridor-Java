This is the final version of the game. 

We have tried our best to complete and make it right as much as we could. There are still some bugs for the code; we could not cover all of them. 
Save and load feature does not work but I did not remove the button as I want to work on this game after my semester too. The problem was regarding load function. I tried to use serialization for save/load functions. But there were some problems and error when load for the game was initialized.

We could not implimented the AI. It was not possible for us in the given time to figure out and execute it.
